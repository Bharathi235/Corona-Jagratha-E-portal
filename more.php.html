            <strong>Lessons for the world from COVID-19 pandemic:</strong><br><br>
1.  All the countries should maintain transparency with the other countries, especially in this kind of virus situations and needs to share important information as soon as possible. Had China alerted the world about the severity of the situation immediately after knowing about the virus, all the other countries would have taken precautions much earlier and the virus could be contained in one place.<br>
2.  Lockdown to reduce the spread of Coronavirus cleared the skies and reduced the pollution to a drastic extent. This made us realize that whatever damage we are doing to the environment can be reversible.<br>
3. It made us focus more on sustainable development.The demand for luxury goods fell to a great extent. COVID-19 hit consumerist culture badly.<br>
4. This phase taught us that excessive consumerism is not needed.Even though coronavirus does not seem to be a biological weapon, the threat of bio-weapons is real. The fight against COVID-19 taught us to be better prepared for the future. Everyone understood that there is a need for more funding, equipment and human resources in the health care industry.<br>
5. It also taught us that vulnerable people like migrant workers will be most affected by this kind of situations. This phase taught us to take immediate steps to protect vulnerable people.<br>
6. Living in a globalised world has advantages and disadvantages as well. Almost every country is depending on the other countries for many goods. In the COVID-19 pandemic phase, when imports and exports are badly affected, all the countries are realising the importance of self-sufficiency.<br>
7.  During this phase, many companies especially IT companies allowed their employees to work from home. It reduced traffic and enabled people to spend more time with their families. COVID-19 taught companies that work from home option is not as bad as they thought.<br>
8.  Many people are now relying on the internet for many purposes like educating their children, availing telemedicine facilities etc. But still many people are deprived of internet access. This COVID-19 phase taught us that internet access should be available to all to prevent deepening inequality.<br>
9.  Now many people are taking healthy food and avoiding junk food     to boost immunity. Coronavirus taught us to focus on healthy       eating habits.
            <br><br><strong>Impact of COVID-19 on the Global economy:-</strong><br><br>
1) Many people lost jobs, and the informal sector is badly hit. This is a huge setback for economies.<br>
 2) Due to the consumption slowdown in the world, exports and imports are affected. So, this affects the economies of almost all countries.<br>
3) Movement of people is restricted due to the fears over the further spread of COVID-19, and hence tourism industry is facing huge losses. Tourists spend money in the countries they visit, so the loss of this money is affecting the economies of many countries.<br>
 4) Due to low demand for fuel, crude oil prices have dropped. Low crude oil prices are beneficial to oil-importing countries like India and detrimental to the economies of OPEC (Organization of petroleum exporting countries) countries like Saudi Arabia.<br>
5) According to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), China is the biggest exporter and second-biggest importer of merchandise as of 2019. Many industries in other countries are depending on China for many raw goods such as pharmaceutical ingredients, automobile components etc. So, coronavirus has hit global supply chains badly. As many factories in China were closed at the start of the pandemic, production has halted for the dependent companies in other countries. Some companies are going for alternatives, which is the costlier option.<br>
6)  Pharmaceutical companies, hygiene products manufacturing companies are benefitting from this situation.
